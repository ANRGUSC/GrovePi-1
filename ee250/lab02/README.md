# **EE 250L Lab 02**

In this lab, you will explore and figure out how to use the python 
libraries provided by Dexter Industries to interface with the various sensors 
and actuators in the GrovePi+ starter kit. In particular, you will use these 
sensors:

 * Grove Ultrasonic Ranger
 * Grove Rotary Angle Sensor
 * Grove Buzzer
 * Grove LCD RGB Backlight

Your task is to read the distance reported by the ultrasonic ranger and trigger
a buzzer sound when the distance reported falls under a threshold. This 
threshold will be selectable using the rotary angle sensor. Lastly, you will
display the current ultrasonic ranger reading and threshold value on the LCD.
